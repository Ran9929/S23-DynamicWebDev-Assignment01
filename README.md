## how to set up and run your application.
I download VSCode, Git and Githubb Desktop, and create a SSH, but I think I didn't use it. I don't know why.
## how you built your HTML page
First, I create a new repo in github, and clone it by Github Desktop. And then open it in vs code. I create a html file and a folder for animations I made in unity.
## inspiration, process documentation, struggles, references, and questions, like your ITP blog
Recently, I am learning how to use unity to create animations by 1 million cubes. I want to upload it on the web to let others see it.
## how you deployed your work to Glitch.com.
I imported my github Repo's URL to Glitch.
